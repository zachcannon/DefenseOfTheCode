Defense of the Code
================
See project outline in ProjectOutline.md.

We encourage collaborating with other students to learn and teach from each other even when he/she is not your partner. 

##Submission
Submit code and short answers on CSNET separately for each phase. 
We will only require a single submission for each pair or individual.
###Deadlines
1. Phase 1 - Midnight of Tuesday, November 5th
2. Phase 2 and 3 - Midnight of Tuesday, November 19th

##Grading
For more details on the work, go through the project outline.
###Phase 1
- Short answers (identified code smells, refactoring techniques used to eliminate the identified code smells)
- Refactored solution.

###Phase 2
- Solution with different types of units without refactoring into inheritance.
- Refactored solution (inheritance / polymorphism) with more types of units.
- Essay reflecting on adding additional types through subclass over the first solution in this phase (maintainability, readability, duplicate code, adding types or behaviors, etc).

###Phase 3
Complete game solution following good design.

###Refactoring

#### Some Common Techniques
- Add/Remove Parameter
- Decompose Conditional
- Encapsulate Field
- Extract Class, Method, Subclass, Superclass
- Form Template Method
- Hide Delegate, Method
- Inline Method
- Push Down / Pull Up Field, Method
- Reduce Scope of Variable
- Rename Method/Class
- Replace Parameter with Method

###UML Class Diagrams
Some of the resources use UML class diagrams to explain.
