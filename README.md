Defense of the Code
================
See project outline ([ProjectOutline.md](ProjectOutline.md)).

We encourage collaborating with other students to learn and teach from each other even when he/she is not your partner. 

##Submission
Submit code and short answers on CSNET separately for each phase. 
We will only require a single submission for each pair or individual.
###Deadlines
1. Phase 1 - Midnight of Tuesday, November 5th
2. Phase 2 and 3 - Midnight of Tuesday, November 19th

##Grading
For more details on the work, go to [ProjectOutline.md](ProjectOutline.md).
See [SampleSolution.md](SampleSolution.md) to get an idea of what to submit.

NOTE: The code created/submitted for this project will need to compile and run using g++.

###Phase 1 - 30%
- Short answers 
  - Identify at least 4 code smells. - 10%
  - For each code smell, remove the code smell using the appropriate refactoring technique. - 10%
- Deliver code that is working. - 10%

###Phase 2 - 30%
- Solution with different types of units without refactoring into inheritance. - 5%
- Refactor solution using inheritance and polymorphism. Add at least two more types of military units. - 10%
- Essay reflecting on the two solutions above. - 15%
  - Explain what you did for each?
  - If we wanted to add the additional types of military units from part two (where we used inheritance) to part one (no inheritance), what would we have to do?
  - When do we want to use one versus the other?
  - Other benefits of using polymorphism?

###Phase 3 - 40%
- Deliver a working game. - 20%
- Avoid using code smells! - 10% minus 1% for every code smell we find. This is exercising phase 1.
- Use polymorphism in squad. Have squad only coupled to Military Unit and not coupled (referencing) any sub type of MilitaryUnit. - 10%. This is exercising phase 2.

###Refactoring
http://www.refactoring.com/catalog/

#### Some Common Techniques
- Add/Remove Parameter
- Decompose Conditional
- Encapsulate Field
- Extract Class, Method, Subclass, Superclass
- Form Template Method
- Hide Delegate, Method
- Inline Method
- Push Down / Pull Up Field, Method
- Reduce Scope of Variable
- Rename Method/Class
- Replace Parameter with Method

###UML Class Diagrams
Some of the resources use UML class diagrams to explain.

###Inheritance

(Inheritance between classes, What is inherited from the base class?)
###Polymorphism
